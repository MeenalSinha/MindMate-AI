# 🧠 MindMate AI — Your Emotional Wellness Companion
> "Because mental wellness can't wait."

## 📌 Overview

MindMate AI is an AI-powered emotional wellness companion built to provide real-time emotional support when people need it most. It uses sentiment analysis and facial emotion detection to understand users' emotions and respond empathetically.

This project was built in 48 hours for a hackathon to demonstrate how accessible, privacy-first AI can help bridge the gap between self-help tools and mental health care.
